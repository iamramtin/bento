Streams
=======

This docker-compose example shows how to use Benthos in [`--streams`][streams]
mode by setting up a cluster of stream pipelines around NATS.

The cluster consists of following five pipelines which are configured within the
`./configs` directory:

- `trickle_samples` reads sample documents from `./sample.json` and continuously
  writes them to the NATS subject `benthos_messages` at a rate of one message
  every three seconds.
- `webhooks` creates three webhooks which simulate three customer endpoints, and
  prints messages received by these webhooks to stdout prefixed with the
  endpoint that received it.
- `pipe_to_customer_1`, `pipe_to_customer_2` and `pipe_to_customer_3` each read
  messages from the NATS subject `benthos_messages`, perform an arbitrary filter
  or mutation to the message and then send the message to its respective target
  webhook.

It's then possible to monitor how these pipelines interact by observing the
stdout pipe of the Benthos instance. You can add, update and remove streams
dynamically using the [REST HTTP interface][http-streams].

## Run

``` sh
# Run NATS
docker-compose up

# From another shell, run the Benthos pipelines:
benthos --streams --streams-dir ./configs
```
