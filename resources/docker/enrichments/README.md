Enrichments
===========

This docker compose sets a Benthos instance up with a config demonstrating how
Benthos can be used for orchestrating HTTP based enrichment flows. An instance
of [httpbin][httpbin] is used for mocking the enrichment endpoints,
[Prometheus][prometheus] and [Grafana][grafana] are used in order to monitor the
performance and behaviour of the configuration.

# Set up

Edit the data within `sample_data.txt` to the type of input data you wish to
profile with.

Next, edit `benthos.yaml` in order to add processors and features that you wish
to profile against.

Run with `docker-compose up`.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in order to set up your own
dashboards.

Use `go tool pprof http://localhost:4195/debug/pprof/profile` and similar
endpoints to get profiling data.
