The scalability protocols are common communication patterns which will be
familiar to anyone accustomed to service messaging protocols.

This input type should be compatible with any implementation of these protocols,
but nanomsg (http://nanomsg.org/index.html) is the specific target of this type.

Since scale proto messages are only single part we would need a binary format
for interpretting multi part messages. If the input is receiving messages from a
benthos output you can set both to use the benthos binary multipart format with
the 'benthos_multi' flag. Note, however, that this format may appear to be
gibberish to other services, and the input will be unable to read normal
messages with this setting.

Currently only PULL and SUB sockets are supported.`,
