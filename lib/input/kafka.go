Connects to a kafka (0.8+) server. Offsets are managed within kafka as per the
consumer group (set via config). Only one partition per input is supported, if
you wish to balance partitions across a consumer group look at the
'kafka_balanced' input type instead.

The target version by default will be the oldest supported, as it is expected
that the server will be backwards compatible. In order to support newer client
features you should increase this version up to the known version of the target
server.`,
