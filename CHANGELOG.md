## Unreleased

### Added

- New `batch` processor for combining payloads up to a number of bytes.
- New `conditional` processor, allows you to configure a chain of processors to
  only be run if the payload passes a `condition`.
- New `--stream` mode features:
  + POST verb for `/streams` path now supported.
  + New `--streams-dir` flag for parsing a directory of stream configs.

### Changed

- The `condition` processor has been renamed `filter`.
- The `custom_delimiter` fields in any line reader types `file`, `stdin`,
  `stdout`, etc have been renamed `delimiter`, where the behaviour is the same.
