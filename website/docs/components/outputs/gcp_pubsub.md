Sends messages to a GCP Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Metadata from messages are sent as
attributes.

```yaml
output:
  gcp_pubsub:
    project: ""
    topic: ""
    max_in_flight: 1
```


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `project`

`string` The project ID of the topic to publish to.

### `topic`

`string` The topic to publish to.

### `max_in_flight`

`number` The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.
