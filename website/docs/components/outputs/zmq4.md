The zmq4 output type attempts to send messages to a ZMQ4 port, currently only
PUSH and PUB sockets are supported.

ZMQ4 is supported but currently depends on C bindings. Since this is an
annoyance when building or using Benthos it is not compiled by default.

There is a specific docker tag postfix `-cgo` for C builds containing
ZMQ support.

You can also build it into your project by getting libzmq installed on your
machine, then build with the tag:

```sh
go install -tags "ZMQ4" github.com/Jeffail/benthos/v3/cmd/benthos
```

## Fields

### `urls`

`array` A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.

```yaml
# Examples

urls:
- tcp://localhost:5556
```

### `bind`

`bool` Whether the URLs listed should be bind (otherwise they are connected to).

### `socket_type`

`string` The socket type to send with.

Options are: `PUSH`, `PUB`.

### `high_water_mark`

`number` The message high water mark to use.

### `poll_timeout`

`string` The maximum period of time to wait for a message to send before the request is abandoned and reattempted.
