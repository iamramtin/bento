Sends messages to an SQS queue. Metadata values are sent along with the payload
as attributes with the data type String. If the number of metadata values in a
message exceeds the message attribute limit (10) then the top ten keys ordered
alphabetically will be selected.

The fields `message_group_id` and `message_deduplication_id` can be
set dynamically using
[function interpolations](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions), which are
resolved individually for each message of a batch.

### Credentials

By default Benthos will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS
services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level,
allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more
[in this document](/docs/guides/aws).

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).
