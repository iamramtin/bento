Publish to a NATS Stream subject.

```yaml
output:
  nats_stream:
    urls:
    - nats://127.0.0.1:4222
    cluster_id: test-cluster
    subject: benthos_messages
    client_id: benthos_client
    max_in_flight: 1
```


This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.
