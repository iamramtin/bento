Publish to an NATS subject.

```yaml
output:
  nats:
    urls:
    - nats://127.0.0.1:4222
    subject: benthos_messages
    max_in_flight: 1
```

This output will interpolate functions within the subject field, you
can find a list of functions [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `urls`

`array` A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.

### `subject`

`string` The subject to publish to.

This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

### `max_in_flight`

`number` The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.
