Pushes messages onto the end of a Redis list (which is created if it doesn't
already exist) using the RPUSH command.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  redis_list:
    url: tcp://localhost:6379
    key: benthos_list
    max_in_flight: 1
```


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `url`

The URL of a Redis server to connect to. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"tcp://localhost:6379"`  

```yaml
# Examples

url: tcp://localhost:6379
```

### `key`

The key of a Redis list.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"benthos_list"`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`
