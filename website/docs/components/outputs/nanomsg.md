```yaml
output:
  nanomsg:
    bind: false
    max_in_flight: 1
    poll_timeout: 5s
    socket_type: PUSH
    urls:
    - tcp://localhost:5556
```

The scalability protocols are common communication patterns. This output should
be compatible with any implementation, but specifically targets Nanomsg.

Currently only PUSH and PUB sockets are supported.

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.
