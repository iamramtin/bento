Sends messages as a continuous stream of line delimited data over a
(tcp/udp/unix) socket by connecting to a server.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  socket:
    network: unix
    address: /tmp/benthos.sock
    codec: lines
```

Each message written is followed by a delimiter (defaults to '\n' if left empty)
and when sending multipart messages (message batches) the last message ends with
double delimiters. E.g. the messages "foo", "bar" and "baz" would be written as:

```
foo\n
bar\n
baz\n
```

Whereas a multipart message [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ] would be written as:

```
foo\n
bar\n
baz\n\n
```

## Fields

### `network`

The network type to connect as.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"unix"`  
Options: `unix`, `tcp`, `udp`.

### `address`

The address (or path) to connect to.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"/tmp/benthos.sock"`  

```yaml
# Examples

address: /tmp/benthos.sock

address: localhost:9000
```

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output file. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"lines"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `all-bytes` | Write the message to the file in full. If the file already exists the old content is deleted. |
| `append` | Append messages to the file. |
| `lines` | Append messages to the file followed by a line break. |
| `delim:x` | Append messages to the file followed by a custom delimiter. |


```yaml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar
```
