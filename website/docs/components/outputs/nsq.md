Publish to an NSQ topic.

```yaml
output:
  nsq:
    nsqd_tcp_address: localhost:4150
    topic: benthos_messages
    user_agent: benthos_producer
    max_in_flight: 1
```

The `topic` field can be dynamically set using function interpolations
described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions). When sending
batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `nsqd_tcp_address`

`string` The address of the target NSQD server.

### `topic`

`string` The topic to publish to.

This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

### `user_agent`

`string` A user agent string to connect with.

### `max_in_flight`

`number` The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.
