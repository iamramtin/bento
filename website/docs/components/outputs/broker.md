Allows you to route messages to multiple child outputs using a range of
brokering [patterns](#patterns).

# Common config fields, showing default values

[Processors](/docs/components/processors/about) can be listed to apply across
individual outputs or all outputs:

``` yaml
output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
    - foo:
        foo_field_1: value1
    - bar:
        bar_field_1: value2
        bar_field_2: value3
      # Processors only applied to messages sent to bar.
      processors:
      - type: bar_processor

  # Processors applied to messages sent to all brokered outputs.
  processors:
  - type: some_processor
```

## Fields

### `copies`

The number of copies of each configured output to spawn.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `pattern`

The brokering pattern to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"fan_out"`  
Options: `fan_out`, `fan_out_sequential`, `round_robin`, `greedy`, `try`.

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to dispatch at any given time. Only relevant for `fan_out`, `fan_out_sequential` brokers.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `outputs`

A list of child outputs to broker.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  
Default: `{"byte_size":0,"condition":{"static":false,"type":"static"},"count":1,"period":"","processors":[]}`  

```yaml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  condition:
    bloblang: this.contains("END BATCH")
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.condition`

A [condition](/docs/components/conditions/about) to test against each message entering the batch, if this condition resolves to `true` then the batch is flushed.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{"static":false,"type":"static"}`  

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yaml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

processors:
  - merge_json: {}
```

## Patterns

The broker pattern determines the way in which messages are allocated and can be
chosen from the following:

### `fan_out`

With the fan out pattern all outputs will be sent every message that passes
through Benthos in parallel.

If an output applies back pressure it will block all subsequent messages, and if
an output fails to send a message it will be retried continuously until
completion or service shut down.

### `fan_out_sequential`

Similar to the fan out pattern except outputs are written to sequentially,
meaning an output is only written to once the preceding output has confirmed
receipt of the same message.

### `round_robin`

With the round robin pattern each message will be assigned a single output
following their order. If an output applies back pressure it will block all
subsequent messages. If an output fails to send a message then the message will
be re-attempted with the next input, and so on.

### `greedy`

The greedy pattern results in higher output throughput at the cost of
potentially disproportionate message allocations to those outputs. Each message
is sent to a single output, which is determined by allowing outputs to claim
messages as soon as they are able to process them. This results in certain
faster outputs potentially processing more messages at the cost of slower
outputs.
