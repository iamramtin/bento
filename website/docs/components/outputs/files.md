Writes each individual message to a new file.

```yaml
output:
  files:
    path: ${!count:files}-${!timestamp_unix_nano}.txt
```

In order for each message to create a new file the path must use function
interpolations as described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

## Fields

### `path`

`string` The file to write to, if the file does not yet exist it will be created.

This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).
