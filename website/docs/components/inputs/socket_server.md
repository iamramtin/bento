```yaml
input:
  socket_server:
    address: /tmp/benthos.sock
    delimiter: ""
    max_buffer: 1e+06
    multipart: false
    network: unix
```

Creates a server that receives messages over a (tcp/udp/unix) socket. Each
connection is parsed as a continuous stream of line delimited messages.

If multipart is set to false each line of data is read as a separate message. If
multipart is set to true each line is read as a message part, and an empty line
indicates the end of a message.

If the delimiter field is left empty then line feed (\n) is used.

The field `max_buffer` specifies the maximum amount of memory to
allocate _per connection_ for buffering lines of data. If a line of data from a
connection exceeds this value then the connection will be closed.
