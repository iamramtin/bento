BETA: This component is experimental and therefore subject to change outside of
major version releases.

Reads messages from a sequence of child inputs, starting with the first and once
that input gracefully terminates starts consuming from the next, and so on.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  sequence:
    inputs: []
```

This input is useful for consuming from inputs that have an explicit end but
must not be consumed in parallel.

## Fields

### `inputs`

An array of inputs to read from sequentially.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

## Examples

A common use case might be to generate a message at the end of our main input:

```yaml
input:
  sequence:
    inputs:
      - csv:
          paths: [ ./dataset.csv ]
      - bloblang:
          count: 1
          mapping: 'root = {"status":"finished"}'
```

With this config once the records within `./dataset.csv` are exhausted
our final payload `{"status":"finished"}` will be routed
through the pipeline.
