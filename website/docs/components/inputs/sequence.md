BETA: This input is experimental and is therefore subject to breaking changes
outside of major version releases.

Reads messages from a sequence of child inputs, starting with the first and once
that input gracefully terminates starts consuming from the next, and so on.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  sequence:
    inputs: []
```

This input is useful for consuming from inputs that have an explicit end but
must not be consumed in parallel.

## Fields

### `inputs`

An array of inputs to read from sequentially.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

## Examples

Read from three CSV files sequentially:

```yaml
input:
  sequence:
    inputs:
      - file:
          format: csv
          path: ./first.csv
      - file:
          format: csv
          path: ./second.csv
      - file:
          format: csv
          path: ./third.csv
```
