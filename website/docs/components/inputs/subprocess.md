BETA: This component is experimental and therefore subject to change outside of
major version releases.

Executes a command, runs it as a subprocess, and consumes messages from it over stdout.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  subprocess:
    name: ""
    args: []
    codec: lines
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  subprocess:
    name: ""
    args: []
    codec: lines
    max_buffer: 65536
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Messages are consumed according to a specified codec. The command is executed once and if it terminates the input also closes down. In order to instead restart the process this input can be placed within a [`read_until` input](/docs/components/inputs/read_until/).

The field `max_buffer` defines the maximum message size able to be read from the subprocess. This value should be set significantly above the real expected maximum message size.

The execution environment of the subprocess is the same as the Benthos instance, including environment variables and the current working directory.
