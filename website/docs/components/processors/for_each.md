A processor that applies a list of child processors to messages of a batch as
though they were each a batch of one message.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
for_each: []
```

This is useful for forcing batch wide processors such as
[`dedupe`](/docs/components/processors/dedupe) or interpolations such
as the `value` field of the `metadata` processor to execute
on individual message parts of a batch instead.

Please note that most processors already process per message of a batch, and
this processor is not needed in those cases.
