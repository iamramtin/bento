Parses selected messages of a batch as JSON documents, attempts to merge them
into one single JSON document and then writes it to a new message at the end of
the batch.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
merge_json:
  retain_parts: false
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
merge_json:
  retain_parts: false
  parts: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Merged parts are removed unless `retain_parts` is set to
true. The new merged message will contain the metadata of the first part to be
merged.

The functionality of this processor depends on being applied across messages
that are batched. You can find out more about batching [in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `retain_parts`

`bool` Whether messages that are merged should also have their original contents preserved.

### `parts`

`array` An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.
