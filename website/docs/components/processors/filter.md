Tests each message batch against a condition, if the condition fails then the
entire batch is dropped. You can find a [full list of conditions here](/docs/components/conditions/about).

```yaml
filter:
  text:
    arg: ""
    operator: equals_cs
    part: 0
  type: text
```

In order to instead filter individual messages of a batch use the
[`filter_parts`](/docs/components/processors/filter_parts) processor.
