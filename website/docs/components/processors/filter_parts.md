Tests each individual message of a batch against a condition, if the condition
fails then the message is dropped. If the resulting batch is empty it will be
dropped. You can find a [full list of conditions here](/docs/components/conditions/about), in this
case each condition will be applied to a message as if it were a single message
batch.
