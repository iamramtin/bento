Tests each message against a [condition](/docs/components/conditions/about), if
the condition fails then the message is dropped.

```yaml
filter_parts:
  text:
    arg: ""
    operator: equals_cs
    part: 0
  type: text
```

You can find a [full list of conditions here](/docs/components/conditions/about).
