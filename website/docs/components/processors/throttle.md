```yaml
throttle:
  period: 100us
```

Throttles the throughput of a pipeline to a maximum of one message batch per
period. This throttle is per processing pipeline, and therefore four threads
each with a throttle would result in four times the rate specified.

The period should be specified as a time duration string. For example, '1s'
would be 1 second, '10ms' would be 10 milliseconds, etc.
