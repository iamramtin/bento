A processor that extracts the value of a field [dot path](/docs/configuration/field_paths)
within payloads according to a specified [codec](#codec), applies a list of
processors to the extracted value and finally sets the field within the original
payloads to the processed result.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
process_field:
  codec: json
  path: ""
  result_type: string
  processors: []
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
process_field:
  codec: json
  path: ""
  result_type: string
  processors: []
  parts: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The result can be marshalled into a specific data type with the field
[`result_type`](#result_type).

It's therefore possible to use this codec without any child processors as a way
of casting string values into other types. For example, with an input JSON
document `{"foo":"10"}` it's possible to cast the value of the
field foo to an integer type with:

```yaml
process_field:
  path: foo
  result_type: int
```

## Codecs

### `json`

Parses the payload as a JSON document, extracts and sets the field using a dot
notation path.

### `metadata`

Extracts and sets a metadata value identified by the path field.

## Fields

### `codec`

`string` A [codec](#codec) to use in order to extract (and set) the target field.

Options are: `json`, `metadata`.

### `path`

`string` A [dot path](/docs/configuration/field_paths) pointing to the target field.

### `result_type`

`string` The final data type to marshal the processing result into. The `discard` type is a special case that discards the result of the processing steps entirely.

Options are: `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `object`, `discard`.

### `processors`

`array` A list of child processors to execute on the extracted value.

### `parts`

`array` An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.

## Examples

For example, with an input JSON document `{"foo":"hello world"}`
it's possible to uppercase the value of the field 'foo' by using the JSON codec
and a [`text`](/docs/components/processors/text) child processor:

```yaml
process_field:
  codec: json
  path: foo
  processors:
  - text:
      operator: to_upper
```

If the number of messages resulting from the processing steps does not match the
original count then this processor fails and the messages continue unchanged.
Therefore, you should avoid using batch and filter type processors in this list.
