Performs actions against Redis that aren't possible using a
[`cache`](/docs/components/processors/cache) processor. Actions are
performed for each message of a batch, where the contents are replaced with the
result.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
redis:
  url: tcp://localhost:6379
  operator: scard
  key: ""
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
redis:
  url: tcp://localhost:6379
  operator: scard
  key: ""
  retries: 3
  retry_period: 500ms
  parts: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The field `key` supports
[interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions) resolved
individually for each message of the batch.

For example, given payloads with a metadata field `set_key`, you could
add a JSON field to your payload with the cardinality of their target sets with:

```yaml
- process_field:
    path: meta.cardinality
    result_type: int
    processors:
      - redis:
          url: TODO
          operator: scard
          key: ${!metadata:set_key}
 ```


## Operators

### `scard`

Returns the cardinality of a set, or 0 if the key does not exist.

### `sadd`

Adds a new member to a set. Returns `1` if the member was added.

## Fields

### `url`

`string` The URL of the target Redis instance.

### `operator`

`string` The [operator](#operators) to apply.

Options are: `scard`, `sadd`.

### `key`

`string` A key to use for the target operator.

This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

### `retries`

`number` The maximum number of retries before abandoning a request.

### `retry_period`

`string` The time to wait before consecutive retry attempts.

### `parts`

`array` An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.
