Retains a pseudo-randomly sampled percentage of message batches (0 to 100) and
drops all others. The random seed is static in order to sample
deterministically, but can be set in config to allow parallel samples that are
unique.

```yaml
sample:
  retain: 10
  seed: 0
```

## Fields

### `retain`

`number` The percentage of messages to keep.

### `seed`

`number` A seed for pseudo-random sampling.
