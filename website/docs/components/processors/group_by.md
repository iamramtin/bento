Splits a batch of messages into N batches, where each resulting batch contains a group of messages determined by conditions that are applied per message of the original batch.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
group_by: []
```

Once the groups are established a list of processors are applied to their respective grouped batch, which can be used to label the batch as per their grouping.

The functionality of this processor depends on being applied across messages
that are batched. You can find out more about batching [in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `[].condition`

A [condition](/docs/components/conditions/about/) that is checked against each message individually in order to determine whether it belongs to a group.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

### `[].processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about/) to execute on the newly formed group.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

## Examples

<Tabs defaultValue="Grouped Processing" values={[
{ label: 'Grouped Processing', value: 'Grouped Processing', },
]}>

<TabItem value="Grouped Processing">

Imagine we have a batch of messages that we wish to split into a group of foos and everything else, which should be sent to different output destinations based on those groupings. We also need to send the foos as a tar gzip archive. For this purpose we can use the `group_by` processor with a [`switch`](/docs/components/outputs/switch) output:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - group_by:
      - condition:
          bloblang: 'content().contains("this is a foo")'
        processors:
          - archive:
              format: tar
          - compress:
              algorithm: gzip
          - bloblang: 'meta grouping = "foo"'

output:
  switch:
    cases:
      - check: 'meta("grouping") == "foo"'
        output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: foo_prod
            topic: only_the_foos
      - output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: somewhere_else
            topic: no_foos_here
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
