While is a processor that has a condition and a list of child processors. The
child processors are executed continuously on a message batch for as long as the
child condition resolves to true.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
while:
  at_least_once: false
  condition:
    text:
      arg: ""
      operator: equals_cs
      part: 0
    type: text
  processors: []
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
while:
  at_least_once: false
  max_loops: 0
  condition:
    text:
      arg: ""
      operator: equals_cs
      part: 0
    type: text
  processors: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The field `at_least_once`, if true, ensures that the child processors
are always executed at least one time (like a do .. while loop.)

The field `max_loops`, if greater than zero, caps the number of loops
for a message batch to this value.

If following a loop execution the number of messages in a batch is reduced to
zero the loop is exited regardless of the condition result. If following a loop
execution there are more than 1 message batches the condition is checked against
the first batch only.

You can find a [full list of conditions here](/docs/components/conditions/about).

## Fields

### `at_least_once`

Whether to always run the child processors at least one time.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `max_loops`

An optional maximum number of loops to execute. Helps protect against accidentally creating infinite loops.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `condition`

A [condition](/docs/components/conditions/about) to test for each loop. If the condition fails the loop is stopped.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{"text":{"arg":"","operator":"equals_cs","part":0},"type":"text"}`  

### `processors`

A list of child processors to execute on each loop.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`
