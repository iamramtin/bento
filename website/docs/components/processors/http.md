Performs an HTTP request using a message batch as the request body, and replaces
the original message parts with the body of the response.

</Tabs>

If the batch contains only a single message part then it will be sent as the
body of the request. If the batch contains multiple messages then they will be
sent as a multipart HTTP request using a `Content-Type: multipart`
header.

If you are sending batches and wish to avoid this behaviour then you can set the
`parallel` flag to `true` and the messages of a batch will
be sent as individual requests in parallel. You can also cap the max number of
parallel requests with `max_parallel`. Alternatively, you can use the
[`archive`](/docs/components/processors/archive) processor to create a single message
from the batch.

The `rate_limit` field can be used to specify a rate limit
[resource](/docs/components/rate_limits/about) to cap the rate of requests across all
parallel components service wide.

The URL and header values of this type can be dynamically set using function
interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

In order to map or encode the payload to a specific request body, and map the
response back into the original payload instead of replacing it entirely, you
can use the [`process_map`](/docs/components/processors/process_map) or
 [`process_field`](/docs/components/processors/process_field) processors.

## Response Codes

Benthos considers any response code between 200 and 299 inclusive to indicate a
successful response, you can add more success status codes with the field
`successful_on`.

When a request returns a response code within the `backoff_on` field
it will be retried after increasing intervals.

When a request returns a response code within the `drop_on` field it
will not be reattempted and is immediately considered a failed request.

## Adding Metadata

If the request returns a response code this processor sets a metadata field
`http_status_code` on all resulting messages.

If the field `copy_response_headers` is set to `true` then any headers
in the response will also be set in the resulting message as metadata.
 
## Error Handling

When all retry attempts for a message are exhausted the processor cancels the
attempt. These failed messages will continue through the pipeline unchanged, but
can be dropped or placed in a dead letter queue according to your config, you
can read about these patterns [here](/docs/configuration/error_handling).

## Fields

### `parallel`

`bool` When processing batched messages, whether to send messages of the batch in parallel, otherwise they are sent within a single request.

### `max_parallel`

`number` A limit on the maximum messages in flight when sending batched messages in parallel.

### `request`

`object` Controls how the HTTP request is made.

### `request.url`

`string` The URL to connect to.

### `request.verb`

`string` A verb to connect with

```yaml
# Examples

verb: POST

verb: GET

verb: DELETE
```

### `request.headers`

`object` A map of headers to add to the request.

This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

```yaml
# Examples

headers:
  Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```

### `request.oauth`

`object` Allows you to specify open authentication.

```yaml
# Examples

oauth:
  access_token: baz
  access_token_secret: bev
  consumer_key: foo
  consumer_secret: bar
  enabled: true
  request_url: http://thisisjustanexample.com/dontactuallyusethis
```

### `request.basic_auth`

`object` Allows you to specify basic authentication.

```yaml
# Examples

basic_auth:
  enabled: true
  password: bar
  username: foo
```

### `request.tls`

`object` Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

### `request.tls.enabled`

`bool` Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

### `request.tls.skip_cert_verify`

`bool` Whether to skip server side certificate verification.

### `request.tls.root_cas_file`

`string` The path of a root certificate authority file to use.

### `request.tls.client_certs`

`array` A list of client certificates to use.

```yaml
# Examples

client_certs:
- cert: foo
  key: bar

client_certs:
- cert_file: ./example.pem
  key_file: ./example.key
```

### `request.copy_response_headers`

`bool` Sets whether to copy the headers from the response to the resulting payload.

### `request.rate_limit`

`string` An optional [rate limit](/docs/components/rate_limits/about) to throttle requests by.

### `request.timeout`

`string` A static timeout to apply to requests.

### `request.retry_period`

`string` The base period to wait between failed requests.

### `request.max_retry_backoff`

`string` The maximum period to wait between failed requests.

### `request.retries`

`number` The maximum number of retry attempts to make.

### `request.backoff_on`

`array` A list of status codes whereby retries should be attempted but the period between them should be increased gradually.

### `request.drop_on`

`array` A list of status codes whereby the attempt should be considered failed but retries should not be attempted.

### `request.successful_on`

`array` A list of status codes whereby the attempt should be considered successful (allows you to configure non-2XX codes).
