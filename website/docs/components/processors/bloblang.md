Executes a [Bloblang](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) mapping on messages.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
bloblang: ""
```

Bloblang is a powerful language that enables a wide range of mapping,
transformation and filtering tasks. For more information
[check out the docs](/docs/guides/bloblang/about).

## Error Handling

Bloblang mappings can fail, in which case the message remains unchanged, errors
are logged, and the message is flagged as having failed, allowing you to use
[standard processor error handling patterns](/docs/configuration/error_handling).

However, Bloblang itself also provides powerful ways of ensuring your mappings
do not fail by specifying desired fallback behaviour, which you can read about
[in this section](/docs/guides/bloblang/about#error-handling).

## Examples

### Mapping

Given JSON documents containing an array of fans:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"grace","obsession":0.21},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89},
    {"name":"vic","obsession":0.43}
  ]
}
```

We can reduce the fans to only those with an obsession score above 0.5 with this
mapping:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - bloblang: |
      root = this
      fans = fans.map_each(match {
        this.obsession > 0.5 => this
        _ => deleted()
      })
```

Giving us:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89}
  ]
}
```

### Parsing CSV

Bloblang can be used to parse some basic CSV files, given files of the following
format:

```
foo,bar,baz
1,2,3
7,11,23
89,23,2
```

We can write a parser that does cool things like calculating the sum of each
line:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - bloblang: |
      root = content().string().split("\n").enumerated().map_each(match {
        index == 0 => deleted() # Drop the first line
        _ => match value.trim() {
          this.length() == 0 => deleted() # Drop empty lines
          _ => this.split(",")            # Split the remaining by comma
        }
      }).map_each(
        # Then do something cool like sum each row
        this.map_each(this.trim().number(0)).sum()
      )
```

To give an output like this:

```json
[6,41,114]
```
