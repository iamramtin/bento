BETA: This a beta component and therefore subject to change outside of major
version releases. Consult the changelog for changes before upgrading.

Executes a [Bloblang](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) mapping on messages.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
bloblang: ""
```

[check out the docs](/docs/guides/bloblang/about).

## Examples

Given JSON documents containing an array of fans:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"grace","obsession":0.21},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89},
    {"name":"vic","obsession":0.43}
  ]
}
```

We can reduce the fans to only those with an obsession score above 0.5 with this
mapping:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - bloblang: |
      root = this
      fans = fans.map_each(match {
        this.obsession > 0.5 => this
        _ => deleted()
      })
```

Giving us:

```json
{
  "id":"foo",
  "description":"a show about foo",
  "fans":[
    {"name":"bev","obsession":0.57},
    {"name":"ali","obsession":0.89}
  ]
}
```
