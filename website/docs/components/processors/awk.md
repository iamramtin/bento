Executes an AWK program on messages. This processor is very powerful as it
offers a range of [custom functions](#awk-functions) for querying and mutating
message contents and metadata.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
awk:
  codec: text
  program: BEGIN { x = 0 } { print $0, x; x++ }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
awk:
  codec: text
  program: BEGIN { x = 0 } { print $0, x; x++ }
  parts: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Works by feeding contents as the input based on a [codec](#codecs) and replaces
the contents with the result. If the result is empty (nothing is printed by the
program) then the original message contents remain unchanged.

Comes with a wide range of [custom functions](#awk-functions) for accessing
message metadata, json fields, printing logs, etc. These functions can be
overridden by functions within the program.

## Fields

### `codec`

A [codec](#codecs) defines how messages should be inserted into the AWK program as variables. The codec does not change which [custom Benthos functions](#awk-functions) are available. The `text` codec is the closest to a typical AWK use case.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"text"`  
Options: `none`, `text`, `json`.

### `program`

An AWK program to execute


Type: `string`  
Default: `"BEGIN { x = 0 } { print $0, x; x++ }"`  

### `parts`

An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

## Codecs

The chosen codec determines how the contents of the message are fed into the
program. Codecs only impact the input string and variables initialised for your
program, they do not change the range of custom functions available.

### `none`

An empty string is fed into the program. Functions can still be used in order to
extract and mutate metadata and message contents.

This is useful for when your program only uses functions and doesn't need the
full text of the message to be parsed by the program, as it is significantly
faster.

### `text`

The full contents of the message are fed into the program as a string, allowing
you to reference tokenised segments of the message with variables ($0, $1, etc).
Custom functions can still be used with this codec.

This is the default codec as it behaves most similar to typical usage of the awk
command line tool.

### `json`

An empty string is fed into the program, and variables are automatically
initialised before execution of your program by walking the flattened JSON
structure. Each value is converted into a variable by taking its full path,
e.g. the object:

``` json
{
	"foo": {
		"bar": {
			"value": 10
		},
		"created_at": "2018-12-18T11:57:32"
	}
}
```

Would result in the following variable declarations:

```
foo_bar_value = 10
foo_created_at = "2018-12-18T11:57:32"
```

Custom functions can also still be used with this codec.

## AWK Functions

### `json_get`

Signature: `json_get(path)`

Attempts to find a JSON value in the input message payload by a
[dot separated path](/docs/configuration/field_paths) and returns it as a string.
This function is always available even when the `json` codec is not
used.

### `json_set`

Signature: `json_set(path, value)`

Attempts to set a JSON value in the input message payload identified by a
[dot separated path](/docs/configuration/field_paths), the value argument will be interpreted
as a string. This function is always available even when the `json` codec is not
used.

In order to set non-string values use one of the following typed varieties:

- `json_set_int(path, value)`
- `json_set_float(path, value)`
- `json_set_bool(path, value)`

### `json_array_append`

Signature: `json_array_append(path, value)`

Attempts to append a value to an array identified by a
[dot separated path](/docs/configuration/field_paths). If the target does not
exist it will be created. If the target exists but is not already an array then
it will be converted into one, with its original contents set to the first
element of the array.

The value argument will be interpreted as a string. This function is always
available even when the `json` codec is not used.

In order to append non-string values use one of the following typed varieties:

- `json_array_append_int(path, value)`
- `json_array_append_float(path, value)`
- `json_array_append_bool(path, value)`

### `json_delete`

Signature: `json_delete(path)`

Attempts to delete a JSON field from the input message payload identified by a
[dot separated path](/docs/configuration/field_paths). This function is always available even
when the `json` codec is not used.

### `create_json_object`

Signature: `create_json_object(key1, val1, key2, val2, ...)`

Generates a valid JSON object of key value pair arguments. The arguments are
variadic, meaning any number of pairs can be listed. The value will always
resolve to a string regardless of the value type. E.g. the following call:

`create_json_object("a", "1", "b", 2, "c", "3")`

Would result in this string:

`{"a":"1","b":"2","c":"3"}`

### `create_json_array`

Signature: `create_json_array(val1, val2, ...)`

Generates a valid JSON array of value arguments. The arguments are variadic,
meaning any number of values can be listed. The value will always resolve to a
string regardless of the value type. E.g. the following call:

`create_json_array("1", 2, "3")`

Would result in this string:

`["1","2","3"]`

### `metadata_set`

Signature: `metadata_set(key, value)`

Set a metadata key for the message to a value. The value will always resolve to
a string regardless of the value type.

### `metadata_get`

Signature: `metadata_get(key) string`

Get the value of a metadata key from the message.

### `timestamp_unix`

Signature: `timestamp_unix() int`

Returns the current unix timestamp (the number of seconds since 01-01-1970).

### `timestamp_unix`

Signature: `timestamp_unix(date) int`

Attempts to parse a date string by detecting its format and returns the
equivalent unix timestamp (the number of seconds since 01-01-1970).

### `timestamp_unix`

Signature: `timestamp_unix(date, format) int`

Attempts to parse a date string according to a format and returns the equivalent
unix timestamp (the number of seconds since 01-01-1970).

The format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be
`Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` would be displayed if it were the value.

### `timestamp_unix_nano`

Signature: `timestamp_unix_nano() int`

Returns the current unix timestamp in nanoseconds (the number of nanoseconds
since 01-01-1970).

### `timestamp_unix_nano`

Signature: `timestamp_unix_nano(date) int`

Attempts to parse a date string by detecting its format and returns the
equivalent unix timestamp in nanoseconds (the number of nanoseconds since
01-01-1970).

### `timestamp_unix_nano`

Signature: `timestamp_unix_nano(date, format) int`

Attempts to parse a date string according to a format and returns the equivalent
unix timestamp in nanoseconds (the number of nanoseconds since 01-01-1970).

The format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be
`Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` would be displayed if it were the value.

### `timestamp_format`

Signature: `timestamp_format(unix, format) string`

Formats a unix timestamp. The format is defined by showing how the reference
time, defined to be `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` would be displayed if it
were the value.

The format is optional, and if omitted RFC3339 (`2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00`)
will be used.

### `timestamp_format_nano`

Signature: `timestamp_format_nano(unixNano, format) string`

Formats a unix timestamp in nanoseconds. The format is defined by showing how
the reference time, defined to be `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` would be
displayed if it were the value.

The format is optional, and if omitted RFC3339 (`2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00`)
will be used.

### `print_log`

Signature: `print_log(message, level)`

Prints a Benthos log message at a particular log level. The log level is
optional, and if omitted the level `INFO` will be used.
