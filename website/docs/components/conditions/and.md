And is a condition that returns the logical AND of its children conditions.

```yaml
and: []
```

For example, the following resolves true if a message contains both 'foo' and
'bar':

```yaml
and:
  - text:
      operator: contains
      arg: foo
  - text:
      operator: contains
      arg: bar
```
