Counts messages starting from one, returning true until the counter reaches its
target, at which point it will return false and reset the counter.

```yaml
count:
  arg: 100
```

Each discrete count condition will have its own counter. Parallel processors
containing a count condition will therefore count independently. It is, however,
possible to share the counter across processor pipelines by defining the count
condition as a resource.

## Fields

### `arg`

`number` A number to count towards.

## Examples

This condition is useful when paired with the
[`read_until`](/docs/components/inputs/read_until) input, as it can be
used to cut the input stream off once a certain number of messages have been
read:

```yaml
# Only read 100 messages, and then exit.
input:
  read_until:
    input:
      kafka_balanced:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topics: [ foo, bar ]
        consumer_group: foogroup
      condition:
        not:
          count:
            arg: 100
```
