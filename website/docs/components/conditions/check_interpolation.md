Resolves a string containing
[function interpolations](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions) and then tests
the result against a child condition.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
check_interpolation:
  value: ""
  condition: {}
```

For example, you could use this to test against the size of a message batch:

``` yaml
check_interpolation:
  value: ${! batch_size() }
  condition:
    number:
      operator: greater_than
      arg: 1
```

## Fields

The value to check against the child condition.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions) that are resolved batch wide.


Type: `string`

```yaml
# Examples

```

### `condition`

A child condition to test the field contents against.
