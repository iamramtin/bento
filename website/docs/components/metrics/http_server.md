Serves metrics as [JSON object](#object-format) with the service wide HTTP
service at the endpoints `/stats` and `/metrics`.

```yaml
metrics:
  http_server:
    prefix: benthos
```

This metrics type is useful for debugging as it provides a human readable format
that you can parse with tools such as `jq`

## Fields

### `prefix`

`string` A string prefix to add to all metrics.

## Object Format

The metrics object takes the form of a hierarchical representation of the dot
paths for each metric combined. So, for example, if Benthos exposed two metric
counters `foo.bar` and `bar.baz` then the resulting object might look
like this:

``` json
{
	"foo": {
		"bar": 9
	},
	"bar": {
		"baz": 3
	}
}
```
