Migrating to Version 3
======================

Benthos version 3 comes with some breaking [configuration](#configuration) changes as well as a few breaking [API changes](#go-api).

## Configuration

### JSON Paths

Many components within Benthos use an unspecified "JSON dot path" syntax for querying and setting fields within JSON documents. The format of these paths has been formalised to make them clearer and more generally useful, but this potentially breaks your paths when they query against hierarchies that contain arrays.

The formal specification for v3 can be found [in this document](../field_paths.md).

The following components are affected:

- `awk` processor (all of the `json_*` functions)
- `json` processor (`path` field)
- `process_field` processor (`path` field)
- `process_map` processor (`premap`, `premap_optional`, `postmap` and `postmap_optional` fields)
- `check_field` condition (`path` field)
- `json_field` function interpolation
- `s3` input (`sqs_body_path`, `sqs_bucket_path` and `sqs_envelope_path` fields)
- `dynamodb` output (`json_map_columns` field values)

#### Migration Guide

In order to replicate the exact same behaviour as currently exists your paths should be updated to include the character `*` whereever an array exists. For example, the default value of `sqs_body_path` for the `s3` input has been updated from `Records.s3.object.key` to `Records.*.s3.object.key`.

## Go API

### Modules

Benthos now fully adheres to [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), import paths must therefore now contain the major version (v3) like so:

```go
import "github.com/Jeffail/benthos/v3/lib/processor"
```

It should be pretty quick to update your imports, either using a tool or just:

```sh
grep "Jeffail/benthos" . -Rl | grep -e "\.go$" | xargs -I{} sed -i 's/Jeffail\/benthos/Jeffail\/benthos\/v3/g' {}
```

### Interface Changes

The following interface changes have occurred to core Benthos components:

- `types.Part` has new methods `GetContext` and `SetContext`.

### Other

- Constructors for buffer components now require a `types.Manager`, giving them parity with other components: `buffer.New(conf Config, mgr types.Manager, log log.Modular, stats metrics.Type) (Type, error)`
