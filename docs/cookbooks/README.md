Cookbooks
=========

This is a collection of Benthos snippets demonstrating common but more advanced
patterns in stream processing.

### [Joining Streams of JSON Events](./joining-streams.md)

This cookbook demonstrates how to merge JSON events from parallel streams using
content based rules and a cache of your choice.

### [Enrichment Workflows](./enrichments.md)

This cookbook demonstrates how to enrich a stream of JSON documents with
HTTP services following a dynamic workflow. This method also works with AWS
Lambda functions, subprocesses, etc.

### [Duplicate Monitoring](./duplicate-monitoring.md)

Benthos has a [deduplication processor](../processors/README.md#dedupe) which
makes removing duplicates from a stream easy. However, sometimes we might only
be interested in detecting duplicates without mutating the stream. This cookbook
demonstrates how to passively count duplicates and expose them via metrics
aggregators.
