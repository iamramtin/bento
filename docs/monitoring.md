## Health Checks

Benthos serves two HTTP endpoints for health checks:

- `/ping` can be used as a liveness probe as it always returns a 200.
- `/ready` can be used as a readiness probe as it serves a 200 only when both
  the input and output are connected, otherwise a 503 is returned.

## Metrics

Benthos [exposes lots of metrics](./metrics/paths.md) either to Statsd,
Prometheus or for debugging purposes an HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON
formatted object.

The target destination of Benthos metrics is configurable from the
[metrics section](./metrics/README.md), where it's also possible to rename,
whitelist or blacklist certain metric paths.

## Tracing

Benthos also [emits opentracing events](./tracers/README.md) to a tracer of your
choice, which can be used to visualise the processors within a pipeline.
